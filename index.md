# Aloha Trades

## Overview
The problem: UHM students have a “rapid” churn rate in goods and services. Students leave the dorm for an on-campus apartment and need to get rid of dorm-specific stuff and acquire apartment-specific stuff. Students graduate and need to get rid of stuff because they’re moving off-island. There is therefore a tremendous amount of “campus-specific” goods and services that could be more effectively recycled and reused if there was an effective marketplace for these specific kinds of items.

The solution: The Aloha Trade is an application for UHM students to facilitate buying and selling of student-related goods and services.

## User Guide
### Application functionality
In this section we will go over how to use our application.

### Landing page
Were going to want to change the images with pages we make.

When you retrieve the app at http://localhost:3000, this is what should be displayed:

![](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/raw/main/doc/landing-page.png)

The next step is to use the Login menu to either Login to an existing account or register a new account.

### Login page
Clicking on the Login link, then on the Sign In menu item displays this page:

### Register page
Alternatively, clicking on the Login link, then on the Sign Up menu item displays this page:

![](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/raw/main/doc/register-page.png)


### Landing (after Login) page, non-Admin user
Once you log in (either to an existing account or by creating a new one), the navbar changes as follows:

![](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/raw/main/doc/landing-after-login-page.png)

You can now add new Stuff documents, and list the Stuff you have created. Note you cannot see any Stuff created by other users.

### Add Stuff page
After logging in, here is the page that allows you to add new Stuff:

![](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/raw/main/doc/add-stuff-page.png)

### List Stuff page
After logging in, here is the page that allows you to list all the Stuff you have created:

![](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/raw/main/doc/list-stuff-page.png)

You click the "Edit" link to go to the Edit Stuff page, shown next.

### Edit Stuff page
After clicking on the "Edit" link associated with an item, this page displays that allows you to change and save it:

![](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/raw/main/doc/edit-stuff-page.png)

### Landing (after Login), Admin user
You can define an "admin" user in the settings.json file. This user, after logging in, gets a special entry in the navbar:

![](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/raw/main/doc/admin-landing-page.png)

### Admin page (list all users stuff)
To provide a simple example of a "super power" for Admin users, the Admin page lists all of the Stuff by all of the users:

![](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/raw/main/doc/admin-list-stuff-page.png)

Note that non-admin users cannot get to this page, even if they type in the URL by hand.

## Developer Guide
### Installation

First, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Second, download a copy of aloha-trades. Note that aloha-trades is a private repo and so you will need to request permission from the author to gain access to the repo.

Third, cd into the app directory install the required libraries with:

```
$ meteor npm install
```

### Running the system

fourth, once the libraries are installed, you can run the application by invoking the "start" script.

```
$ meteor npm run start
```

The first time you run the app, it will create some default users and data. Here is the output:

###  *Need to change output in here once we get our version up and running
```
 meteor npm run start

Periodically, you might see `Error starting Mongo (2 tries left): Cannot run replSetReconfig because the node is currently updating its configuration` after the `=> Started HMR server.`. It doesn't seem to be a problem since the MongoDB does start.

### Viewing the running app

If all goes well, the template application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  You can login using the,
* user credentials: john@foo.com & pw: changeme
* admin credentials: admin@foo.com & pw: changeme
* or else register a new account.

### ESLint

You can verify that the code obeys our coding standards by running ESLint over the code in the imports/ directory with:

```
meteor npm run lint
```
